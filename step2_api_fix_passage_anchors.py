Task:
A co-worker was tasked with identifying a unique, verbatim quote from a passage that underpins a particular claim. \
Unfortunately, they made a mistake and the quote they identified is not unique and verbatim. \
Your task is to fix their quote so that it is both verbatim and unique.

-----
Here is an example passage, together with the claim and the erroneous quote.

Passage:
In 1940, she was interned in a French camp as an enemy alien, but managed to escape and eventually make her way to the United States in 1941.  \
Arendt's experiences during this time would deeply influence her work on totalitarianism and human rights. \
In New York, she began to immerse herself in academic life, working as an editor, journalist, and lecturer. \
Her first major work, *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, published in 1951, explored the common roots of Nazism and Stalinism, and established her as a significant voice in political philosophy. \
## A Life Of Controversial, Influential Works  \
Throughout her career, Arendt wrote a number of seminal, and controversial, works. *The Human Condition* (1958) examined the role of politics in modern societies and introduced the concept of "the public realm" â€“ the space where individuals act and participate in political life. \
This exploration of freedom and action would become a recurring theme in her writings.  \
Her 1963 publication, *Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil*, based on her coverage of Adolf Eichmann's trial, ignited significant controversy. \
Arendt argued that Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust, was not a monster but rather an ordinary bureaucrat who unquestioningly followed orders. \
The idea of the "banality of evil" continues to influence discussions on the nature of evil and moral responsibility.  \
Arendt's later works, such as *On Revolution* (1963) and *Between Past and Future* (1968), sought to further unravel the complexities of power, authority, and rebellion. \
Her writings on these subjects continue to resonate with present-day political struggles, as well as with the works of other philosophers like [Immanuel Kant](/philosophy/2023-immanuel-kant-life-and-work) and [Edmund Husserl](/philosophy/2023-edmund-husserl-his-life-and-work).  \

Claim:
*The Origins of Totalitarianism* established Arendt as a significant voice in political philosophy.

Initial attempt at a unique and verbatim quote:
[The Origins of Totalitarianism] established her as a significant voice in political philosophy.

Correct (unique and verbatim) quote:
Her first major work, *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, published in 1951, explored the common roots of Nazism and Stalinism, and established her as a significant voice in political philosophy.
