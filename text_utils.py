She fled Germany in 1933 and settled in Paris, where she became involved with a number of political and social organizations advocating for Jewish refugees. In 1940, she was interned in a French camp as an enemy alien, but managed to escape and eventually make her way to the United States in 1941.\n\nArendt's experiences during this time would deeply influence her work on totalitarianism and human rights. In New York, she began to immerse herself in academic life, working as an editor, journalist, and lecturer. Her first major work, *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, published in 1951, explored the common roots of Nazism and Stalinism, and established her as a significant voice in political philosophy.\n\n## A Life Of Controversial, Influential Works\n\nThroughout her career, Arendt wrote a number of seminal, and controversial, works. *The Human Condition* (1958) examined the role of politics in modern societies and introduced the concept of \"the public realm\" â€“ the space where individuals act and participate in political life. This exploration of freedom and action would become a recurring theme in her writings.\n\nHer 1963 publication, *Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil*, based on her coverage of Adolf Eichmann's trial, ignited significant controversy. Arendt argued that Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust, was not a monster but rather an ordinary bureaucrat who unquestioningly followed orders. The idea of the \"banality of evil\" continues to influence discussions on the nature of evil and moral responsibility.\n\nArendt's later works, such as *On Revolution* (1963) and *Between Past and Future* (1968), sought to further unravel the complexities of power, authority, and rebellion. Her writings on these subjects continue to resonate with present-day political struggles, as well as with the works of other philosophers like [Immanuel Kant](/philosophy/2023-immanuel-kant-life-and-work) and [Edmund Husserl](/philosophy/2023-edmund-husserl-his-life-and-work).\n\n## A Lasting Legacy\n\nHannah Arendt died in 1975, but her work remains as relevant as ever.",
